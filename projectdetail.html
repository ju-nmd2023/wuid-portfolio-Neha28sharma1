      <p>
        These are the two spreads from a coffe table book. The spreads are about
        a famous graphic designer "Stefan Sagmeister". He is known for his
        typography skills.Stefan Sagmeister is one of the most imaginative and
        original creative thinkers around today. Mention his name to any graphic
        designer and chances are you will get enthusiastic words of admiration
        and respect and with good reason! This award-winning designer has
        created some of the boldest, most innovative, most engaging work around,
        especially his type and handwriting-inspired solutions. Sagmeister makes
        type come alive sometimes almost literally. He takes type and fashions
        solutions that are visually dynamic expressions, above and beyond the
        actual meaning of the words. He will on occasion use a human canvas
        whether on himself or others with striking results.
